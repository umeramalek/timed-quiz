<!-- Pseudo Code

1. i want to create a time quiz game where I want these functions:
    1. I want there to be a start button -> so the user can start the game
        *in html make it a clickable button, in java make use addEventListener
    2. I want a timer(for 60sec),once the start button is pressed, that should trigger the timer to start 
    3. once the start button is pressed I want their to be a questions
        * multiple choice and fill in the blank questions
        * for multiple choice questions in java create a questions container and also create an answer container for the right answer
        * for fill in the blank questions, create an input function (possibly in java)
    4. once each question is answered, I want the user to submit each question. 
    5. once each answer is submitted, tell the user if the answer is correct or not 
        * if answer correct display an emoji and if wrong, display the correct answer 
    6. once question is answered, move on to the next question 
    7. end quiz when timer ends 
    8. if user finishes all questions within the given time, end quiz 
    9. show users score 
    10. create a storage to store all the scores 
    11. create a button "view highscores"
    12. once the view high score is clicked, show all scores
        * make it an array - in descending order
        * make sure to make the initial score 0, when the user plays for the first time
    13. create a restart button 
        * when clicked the quiz restartes
