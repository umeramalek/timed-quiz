# timed-quiz
I created a 10 question coding quiz on jaavscipt. This is a timed quiz, for every right answer you get 5 seconds added to your time and for every wring answer you get 20 seconds subtracted from your time. Your score are stored with your name.  


## Getting Started

* create a repo
* write pseudocode 
* create an html and style it 
* added js to it

### Steps
1. i want to create a time quiz game where I want these functions:
    1. I want there to be a start button -> so the user can start the game
        *in html make it a clickable button, in java make use addEventListener
    2. I want a timer(for 120sec),once the start button is pressed, that should trigger the timer to start 
        * the timer should subtract 5 sec for every wrong answer
        * and for every right answer add 20 secs
    3. once the start button is pressed I want their to be a questions
        * multiple choice
        * for multiple choice questions in java create a questions container and also create an answer container for the right answer
    6. once question is answered, move on to the next question 
    7. once all the questions end add a submit button
    8. end quiz when timer ends 
    9. if user finishes all questions within the given time, end quiz 
    10. show users score 
    11. create a storage to store all the scores 
    12. create a button "view highscores"
    13. once the view high score is clicked, show all scores
        * make it an array - in descending order
        * make sure to make the initial score 0, when the user plays for the first time
        * make a container for wiritng name to store the score
    14. create a restart button 
        * when clicked the quiz restarts
